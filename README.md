# MyTrainBackHome

### Attempt to create a React Native App and integrate with Melbourne Train/Tram Timetable. Trying to emulate one really good app called GO app. Idea is to simulate the app and learn the process.

### Features :
1. Register Your Return and Onward Station
2. Select your Route
3. Know time to leave to catch train

### Screenshots ( yet so far...)
